🔍 Overview
Unit 8 explores how Generative AI (GenAI) can support cybersecurity professionals in daily tasks such as understanding vulnerabilities, analyzing alerts, reviewing code, and improving documentation.
The unit also introduces the T‑C‑R‑E‑I prompting framework, which helps you craft effective prompts to get high‑quality outputs from AI tools.

📂 Topics Covered
1. Role of GenAI in Cybersecurity
Assists in understanding vulnerabilities quickly

Helps analyze IDS/IPS alerts

Supports code review and debugging

Enhances productivity and learning

Generates documentation and training materials

2. The T‑C‑R‑E‑I Prompting Framework
T – Thoughtful
Define the task clearly.
Specify the persona (e.g., “I’m a junior analyst”).
Choose the output format (bullets, table, summary).

C – Context
Provide background information that affects the output.
Examples:

“I work on a non‑federal system.”

“I have limited Python experience.”

R – References
Add examples, policies, or guidelines to shape the response.
This ensures accuracy and alignment with your organization.

E – Evaluate
Review the AI output:

Is it accurate?

Is it clear?

Is it suitable for your audience?

I – Iterate
Refine the prompt.
Add missing details.
Request rephrasing, expansion, or examples.

3. Using GenAI for Code Review
GenAI can:

Detect logical errors (e.g., division by zero)

Suggest improvements

Add comments to explain code

Provide safer and more efficient alternatives

This is especially useful for analysts with limited programming experience.

4. Understanding Vulnerabilities with GenAI
GenAI can explain:

What a vulnerability is

Its potential impact

Immediate mitigation steps

Examples discussed:

SSRF

Injection

Cryptographic Failures

Broken Access Control

5. Analyzing Security Alerts
GenAI can:

Prioritize IDS/IPS alerts

Explain why an alert is high/medium/low severity

Suggest next steps

Highlight correlations between alerts

Support incident response decision‑making

6. Improving Professional Documents
GenAI helps you create:

Cover letters tailored to cybersecurity roles

Training guides

Reference sheets

Clear explanations for non‑technical audiences

🧠 Key Skills Gained
Crafting effective prompts

Using GenAI for debugging and code enhancement

Understanding vulnerabilities and mitigation

Analyzing alerts and supporting IR workflows

Creating professional cybersecurity documentation

📌 Summary
Unit 8 teaches you how to integrate Generative AI into your cybersecurity workflow.
The goal is not to replace human judgment, but to enhance your efficiency, accuracy, and learning speed.

GenAI becomes a powerful assistant when you know how to prompt it effectively using the T‑C‑R‑E‑I framework.
